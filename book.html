<h1>Really Honst

Book Reviews</h1>
<p>I read a lot of books about many different subjects. Though I'm not a book critic, and I don't do this for a living. I enjoy a really good read every now and then. Here now and then. Here's a list of books that I've read recently:</p>

<ul>
 	<li><em>The Rainbow Return</em> by E. Smith</li>
<li><em>Seven Steps to Immeasurable Wealth</em> by R. U. Needy</li>

<li><em>The Food-Lovers Guide to Weight Loss</em> by L. Goode</li>
<li><em>The Silly Person's Guide to Seriousness</em> by M. Nott</li> 
</ul>
